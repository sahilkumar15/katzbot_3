ai,"Based on the provided context, it appears that the text was written by a 9/11 first responder who is also a ritual slaughterer and a private individual. They have not given a specific name or title for themselves, so it is difficult to provide a precise answer to this question. However, they have described themselves as a ""nice, quiet guy"" who is not critical or cynical.

If you are asking about the role of the author in relation to the Tanach or Gemara studies mentioned in the context, it is not clear from the provided information what their role is in those areas. They may be a teacher, student, or scholar of those texts, but the context does not provide enough information to make a definitive determination."
